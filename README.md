# Aqwarium (backend)

Backend for the [Aqwarium](https://github.com/justerbaster/aqwarium) frontend.

**Add your backend code here** (from the project archive). This repo currently runs a minimal placeholder server so Railway can deploy it; replace with your real backend when ready.

## After adding your code

- Add a **railway.toml** (or use Railway’s auto-detect) with your build and start commands.
- On [Railway](https://railway.app): **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub** → select **justerbaster/aqwarium-backend**.
- Set environment variables (e.g. database URL) in the service **Variables**.
- In **Networking**, generate a domain. Use that URL in the frontend as the API base (e.g. `<meta name="aqwarium-api-url" content="https://your-backend.up.railway.app">`).
